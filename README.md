## Overview

The CCNA certification is a foundational networking certification that validates skills in:

- Networking fundamentals
- Static routing and OSPF configuration
- NAT and VPN tunnel setup
- Network security
- Automation and programmability

This repository includes a variety of projects aimed at solidifying these skills through practical application.

## Projects

Below is a list of key projects included in this repository:

1. **Basic Network Configuration**
   - Setting up VLANs, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing.
   - Configuring DHCP and static IP addressing.

2. **Routing Protocols**
   - Implementing and testing static routing.
   - Configuring OSPF for single-area and multi-area networks.

3. **Switching Concepts**
   - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) configuration.
   - EtherChannel setup for redundancy and load balancing.

4. **Network Security**
   - Configuring access control lists (ACLs).
   - Implementing port security and securing management interfaces.

5. **NAT and VPN**
   - Configuring Network Address Translation (NAT).
   - Setting up and testing VPN tunnels.

## Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Network simulation and configuration testing.
- **EVE-NG**: Virtual network lab environment.
